WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html – not strictly necessary, but sets the context for the following commands.

RUN rm -rf ./* – deletes the default files (like index.html) so they don't override or interfere.

COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html – puts your index.html and other assets right where Nginx expects them.

Nginx is now serving your files, not its default page.
