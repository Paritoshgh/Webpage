                    It is to the credit of those who ruled across Maharashtra that they were able to build forts in the most unlikely places, at times on terrains that would have been virtually impossible to reach or navigate. And so while there are many forts atop almost insurmountable hills, one of the most unique is the one at Janjira. This island fort stands on a rocky outcrop near the mouth of the Rajpuri Creek and never once was it conquered by the enemies of those who ruled here because of its location.

                    The Janjira island fort is a marvel of architectural achievement, situated deep in the sea about 3 km from the coastal town of Murud. Though the Arabian Sea crashes relentlessly all around the fort, its impregnable walls continue to stand strong and tall at 40 feet high, even at full tide. It is spread over 22 acres and has 19 towers and a huge number of turrets, each of which had a cannon installed on it, some of which have remained intact. Originally the fort was a small wooden structure built by a Koli chief in the late 15th century. It was captured by Pir Khan, a general of Nizamshah of Ahmednagar. Later, the fort was strengthened by Malik Ambar, the Abyssinian-origin Siddi regent of Ahmednagar kings. From then onward, the Siddis became independent and the fort continued to be occupied by them, undefeated despite many attacks.

                    All the rounded bastions of the fort are still intact. There are many cannons of native and European make rusting on the bastions. Now in ruins, the fort in its heyday was a full-fledged living fort with all the necessary facilities, as for example palaces, quarters for officers, mosque, two big fresh water tanks, etc. On the outer wall flanking the main gate, there is a sculpture depicting a tiger-like beast holding four elephants in four legs, one elephant held tightly by his tail and the sixth elephant in the jaws.
